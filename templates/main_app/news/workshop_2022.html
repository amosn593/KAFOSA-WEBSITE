    Entrepreneurial vision is very critical in making a business achieve better
    growth and development. When covid-19 was at its peak in the country many
    SACCOs grappled with how to continue giving services and the ones related
    with aviation, hospitality and other industries tapped into their savings to
    sustain themselves as they were negatively affected.

    Through use of Technology SACCOs have managed to continue serving their
    members as they innovate around new ways to survive and thrive. The digital
    consumption was at its all-time highest during the pandemic and technology
    aided operations in many sectors.

    ICT as an excellent enabler plays a pivotal role in enhancing efficiency
    resulting in profitability of SACCOs through components such as cost
    reduction, cheaper distribution channels and reduction in supply time,
    innovation and good customer services.

    and awareness challenges, Technical challenges, and Human resource
    challenges, Stakeholder challenges, Cyber security threats.
